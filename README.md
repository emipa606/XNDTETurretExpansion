# **Overview**

TE Turret Expansion is a vanilla-friendly turret mod that uses the extended turret framework from Turret Extensions, which gives each added turret various unique characteristics compared to other turret mods (e.g. limited firing arcs and upgrades). This mod currently adds four turrets across two tech levels:

All turrets use vanilla research projects and are also upgradable. TE Turret Expansion also makes the following minor changes to vanilla turrets...

**Mini-Turret:**
Can now be upgraded to be made...

- Somewhat more accurate
- More reliable with a slightly stronger barrel



**Autocannon Turret:**
Can now be upgraded to be made...

- Significantly more durable (both HP and barrel)
- Somewhat less flammable
- Somewhat more accurate



**Uranium Slug Turret:**
Can now be upgraded to be made...

- Significantly more durable (both HP and barrel)
- Somewhat less flammable
- Somewhat more accurate
- Quicker to fire



**Mortar:**
Can now be upgraded to be made...

- Considerably more accurate
- Somewhat quicker to fire



# **Compatibility**

**Mods:**
Requires https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1496122245]**Turret Extensions** in order to work properly. 

Incompatible with Combat Extended. There are no other known incompatibilities.

**Saves:**
Should be safely addable to ongoing savegames. There will be one-off errors when removing this from ongoing savegames though, and you will lose TE Turret Expansion-added turrets and all upgrades to vanilla turrets.
