[h1][b]Overview[/b][/h1]
TE Turret Expansion is a vanilla-friendly turret mod that uses the extended turret framework from Turret Extensions, which gives each added turret various unique characteristics compared to other turret mods (e.g. limited firing arcs and upgrades). This mod currently adds four turrets across two tech levels:

[h1][b]Compatibility[/b][/h1]
[b]Mods:[/b]
Requires [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2810485459][b]Turret Extensions[/b][/url] in order to work properly. 

Incompatible with Combat Extended. There are no other known incompatibilities.

[b]Saves:[/b]
Should be safely addable to ongoing savegames. There will be one-off errors when removing this from ongoing savegames though, and you will lose TE Turret Expansion-added turrets and all upgrades to vanilla turrets.
